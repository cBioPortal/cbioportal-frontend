                    Cohort entry is based on many factors, including NGS
                    profiling in specific years. These selection criteria could
                    affect the ability to generalize to the entirety of patients
                    with the specific cancer type. Genomic profiling is not
                    always performed at diagnosis and therefore may lead to
                    several forms of bias, including immortal time bias.

                    Investigators who wish to test specific hypotheses should
