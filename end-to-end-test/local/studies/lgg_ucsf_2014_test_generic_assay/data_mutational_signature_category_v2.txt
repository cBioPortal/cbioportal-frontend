mutational_signature_category_13	Signature 13 (APOBEC)	Signature 13 has been found in 22 cancer types and seems to be commonest in cervical and bladder cancers. In most of these 22 cancer types, Signature 13 is present in at least 10% of samples. Signature 13 has been attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases converting cytosine to uracil.

Signature 13 causes predominantly C>G mutations. This may be due to generation of abasic sites after removal of uracil by base excision repair and replication over these abasic sites by REV1.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt	not significant	not significant	significant	significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant

mutational_signature_category_29	Signature 29 (Tobacco)	Signature 29 has been observed only in gingivo-buccal oral squamous cell carcinoma. Signature 29 has been found in cancer samples from individuals with a tobacco chewing habit. Signature 29 exhibits transcriptional strand bias for C>A mutations indicating guanine damage that is most likely repaired by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Signature 29 is also associated with CC>AA dinucleotide substitutions. The Signature 29 pattern of C>A mutations due to tobacco chewing appears different from the pattern of mutations due to tobacco smoking reflected by Signature 4.	https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2.tt	not significant	marginally significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	significant	not significant	significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	significant	significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant	not significant
